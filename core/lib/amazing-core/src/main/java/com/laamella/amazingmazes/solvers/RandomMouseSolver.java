/**
 * Random mouse: For contrast, here's an inefficient Maze solving method, which
 * is basically to move randomly, i.e. move in one direction and follow that
 * passage through any turnings until you reach the next junction. Don't do any
 * 180 degree turns unless you have to. This simulates a human randomly roaming
 * the Maze without any memory of where they've been. It's slow and isn't
 * guaranteed to ever terminate or solve the Maze, and once the end is reached
 * it will be just as hard to retrace your steps, but it's definitely simple and
 * doesn't require any extra memory to implement.
